
As per [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations)
there is a canonical location for `settings.json`

> Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:
> - Windows `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`
> - macOS `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`
> - Linux `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

`keybindings.json` also lives here.
